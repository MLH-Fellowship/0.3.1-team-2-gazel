## Idea used

Here, we are making use of the Weber fraction to convert the given problem into a differential equation. Since the solution object isn't dependent on time, we calculate 
only once, and binary search through the solution array at every iteration

This function has been used as a reference for the ``__init__()`` method in gazel.jl
